# Custom AI rules for Sumo Marketing Website
1. **Component Structure**: Always generate reusable components extending shadcn/ui (e.g., button.tsx, card.tsx). Use TypeScript with typed props (e.g., `interface Props { title: string; videoSrc?: string; cta: { label: string; href: string } }`). Include Framer Motion animations (e.g., `motion.div` with `whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}`).
2. **Visuals Priority**: Ensure 70% visual content per page/component: Embed Unsplash/Pexels images (cafes, chains, kitchens), dashboard screenshots, or 30-60s animated explainer videos (use Framer Motion for transitions). Add SEO-optimized alt texts (e.g., "AI-powered restaurant inventory dashboard").
3. **Conversion Focus**: Include at least one CTA per component (e.g., `PrimaryButton.tsx` for trial/demo). Use empowering copy (e.g., "Upgrade from dumb software—start your free trial"). Track interactions with GA4 events (e.g., `form_submission`, `video_play`).
4. **Content Tone**: Write for cafe/chain owners/managers frustrated with outdated software. Use relatable, benefit-driven copy (e.g., "Sumo’s AI cuts outlet chaos by 40%"). Generate realistic case studies (e.g., "ChainX: 25% waste reduction with SumoBot").
5. **SEO & Multilingual**: Add meta/OG tags and schema (e.g., VideoObject for explainers). Use keywords like "restaurant inventory management," "franchise tracking." Implement next-intl for English/Spanish; include hreflang tags.
6. **Interactive Demos**: Prioritize AI analytics/inventory tracking for interactive components (e.g., `InteractiveDemo.tsx` with SumoBot chat iframe). Use Framer Motion for hover/click animations (e.g., scale, fade).
7. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure mobile-first design with touch gestures (e.g., `SwipeableCards.tsx` for feature galleries). Add sticky CTAs (e.g., `MobileCTA.tsx` with trial link). Test for <3s load with lazy-loaded visuals.
8. **Blog Placeholder**: For blog components (e.g., `BlogCard.tsx`), generate CMS-ready stubs with 3 sample templates (e.g., "Top Tips for Franchise Inventory"). Avoid full blog content generation until CMS is active.
